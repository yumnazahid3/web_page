First of its kind on H5U! Astral features a flat, minimalistic design, a fully animated 
interface (with noscript fallbacks), and styling for all basic page elements (including 
blockquotes, tables and lists). Enjoy!

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
